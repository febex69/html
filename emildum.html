    <h2>What Happens When You Cum</h2>
    <p>Ejaculation is the release of semen from the penis. It usually happens during sexual activity or masturbation. It involves both physical and mental processes.</p>

    <h2>Physical Effects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Muscle contractions</li>
        <li>Increased heart rate</li>
        <li>Short-term energy release</li>
        <li>Refractory period (time before you can ejaculate again)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mental Effects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Release of dopamine → feeling of reward</li>
        <li>Release of prolactin → relaxation</li>
        <li>Release of oxytocin → calmness or bonding</li>
        <li>Temporary clarity or mental reset for some people</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>The effects vary from person to person. Some feel energized afterward, some feel tired. There’s no long-term cognitive boost; the clarity people feel is mostly due to tension release.</p>
